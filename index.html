    <h1>The tutorial story</h1>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who
      can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To
      join our movement, <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now. testing a soft wrap line here to see if it actually returns. It does!!

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      Learn Enough is an outgrowth of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>. This page is part of the sample site for <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough HTML</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper<strong> T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web. Other related tutorials can be found at <a href="http://learnenough.com/">learnenough.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Founders</h2>

      <p>
        Learn Enough was founded in 2015 by Homer Simpson, General Custer, and Carson Wentz. We beleive that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can beneft <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em>, and probably more

    <h3>Homer Simpson</h3>

    <p>
      Homer is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
      Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
      <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
      introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
      <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a>.

    <h3>General Custer</h3>

    <p>
      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Custer in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <h3>Carson Wentz</h3>

    <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
